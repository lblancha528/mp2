// QuickCalculator DOES NOT WORK
//   My thought was to somehow package each individual command from the command line
//   into individual arrays to then pass to InteractiveCalculator since I already wrote
//   the code that handles sorting arguments by type and running the appropriate methods
//   however IC never uses the command line input, though it is set up to take it. I am not
//   sure how to either use IC's eyes to read the input from QC, or to set up QC to pass
//   the appropriate content to IC, not the whole command line.
//   I would think it's bad practice to rewrite QC in the image of IC as they would be
//   nearly identical except for where they get their input and an additional layer of 
//   sorting through that input.
// This was mostly just a brain dump for future me when I inevitably need to resubmit this, 
//  but input is always appreciated.
