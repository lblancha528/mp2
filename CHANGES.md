**Changes**
* Fixed style errors noted by 'mvn checkstyle:check'
* Got QC working. Most of the functionality was copied from IC
    but I worked to convert the 'use scanner to read terminal' 
    approach to 'use String[] to read command line'.
* Add many if lines to the 'run' section so that the output
    prints register names if given register names
* Added correct print line for STORE operation
